	/// @brief the main game loop.
	/// 
	/// A complete loop involves processing SFML events, updating and drawing all game objects.
	/// The actual elapsed time for a single game loop is calculated. If this value is 
	///  greater than the target time for one loop (1 / 60), then (and only then) is an update 
	///  operation performed.
	/// The target is at least one update and one render cycle per game loop, but typically 
	///  more render than update operations will be performed as we expect our game loop to
	///  complete in less than the target time.
